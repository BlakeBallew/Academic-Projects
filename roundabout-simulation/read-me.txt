Description: explains assumptions/usage of the simulation


General Assumptions of the simulation:

-No drivers need to make U-turns
-Destination is random
-Roundabout contains four "slots" for cars to occupy
-There are four inlets/exits to the roundabout
-All inlets share the same probabiity that, given an open slot, there will be a 
car waiting there to take it
(^*if there are differing probabilities, set the uniform probability to be the average of the four
as our previous assumption that destinations are random allows this to work/function roughly the same)
-Cars are uniform in size
-Drivers are more or less "perfect"
-If a car exits, it is assumed a turn signal was used (by prev. assumption) and hence any car waiting
can enter the roundabout while the previous car exits (effectively replacing their spot)

Simulation Usage:

Simulation functions are located in testing.py, which contains three functions. To run a function,
type the name of that function via the command line upon running testing.py followed by the parameters of
that function (all separated by spaces).

Parameters:
-C is the (average or approx) time needed for a car to go around the entire roundabout
(we can think of this as containing the info for the size of the roundabout as well as the speed limit)
-S is the number of seconds we wish to simulate
-P is the probability [0,1] in the form X/100 that if there is an open spot in the roundabout passing one 
of the four inlets, there will be a car waiting there to take that spot

sample tests:

>python testing.py P_constant 3600 40
where S = 3600 seconds (one hour) and P = 0.40 which we call 40 since 40/100 = 0.40

>python testing.py C_constant 3600 16
where S = 3600 seconds and C = 16 is the avg number of seconds needed for a 
car to circle this specific roundabout

>python testing.py C_P_constant 3600 78 16
where S = 3600 seconds, P = 0.78 (78/100), and C = 16
