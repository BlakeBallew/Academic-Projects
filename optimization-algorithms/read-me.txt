------Files------

--Armijo--

-Performs an Armijo line search looking for a suitable step size
along the current descent direction

--test_functions--

-Contains three python functions which represent three common test functions
for minimization algorithms including the Rosenbrock and Beale functions
-Each python function outputs the value and gradient of the function it represents

--gradient_descent--
-Performs classic gradient descent algorithm, where each descent
direction is just the opposite direction as the gradient

--BFGS_descent--
-Performs Quasi-Newton method of minimization, where the Hessian is approximated
via the BFGS (Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb, and Shanno) formula

--updateBFGS--
-Performs a single BFGS update

------Input------

-Both gradient_descent.py and BFGS_descent.py take two command line arguments representing the two
starting coordinates as input.
-Example input:     >python BFGS_descent.py 1.1 1.1
-Note that if we wanted to test the Rosenbrock function instead of the Beale function,
it would be necessary for us to manually change all instances of "test_functions.Beale(___)"
to "test_functions.Rosenbrock(___)" in the respective algorithm's file.
