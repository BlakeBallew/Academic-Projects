------Files------

--Armijo--

-Performs an Armijo line search looking for a suitable step size
along the current descent direction

--test_functions--

-Contains three python functions which represent three common test functions
for minimization algorithms including the Rosenbrock and Beale functions
-Each python function outputs the value and gradient of the function it represents

--gradient_descent--
-Performs classic gradient descent algorithm, where each descent
direction is just the opposite direction as the gradient

--BFGS_descent--
-Performs Quasi-Newton method of minimization, where the Hessian is approximated
via the BFGS (Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb, and Shanno) formula

--updateBFGS--
-Performs a single BFGS update
